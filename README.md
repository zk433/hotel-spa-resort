# Hotel Spa Resort website
## Foundation for sites course project

In this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/foundation-5-sass-learn-by-building-a-complete-website/learn/v4/overview) course I learned about [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS framework, which was used to develop this multi-page website. 

I completed the project based on the requirements and I added some effects and styling to improve the original functionality and design.
